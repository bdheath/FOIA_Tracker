Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Freedom of Information Act request</u>


Dear [@GREETING]:

Under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, I hereby request [@RECORDS].

Because this is a request by the news media for records in the public interest, I ask that you waive any search fees in accordance with § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). If the fee for retrieving or reproducing these records will exceed $50, please notify me before filling this request. I can be reached at [@PHONE] or by electronic mail at [@EMAIL].

Further, I remind you that the President has directed that the FOIA "be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails." Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Dep'ts and Agencies, 74 Fed. Reg. 15, 4683 (Jan. 26, 2009). This instruction is unambiguous: "All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government. The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA." <i>Id.</i>

If for any reason any portion of this request is denied, please provide written notice of the legal justification for the denial and an index of any documents or portions of documents that were withheld, as required under <i>Vaughn v. Rosen</i>, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1972), cert. denied 415 U.S. 977 (1972). Please also provide the name and address of the officer or body to which my appeal should be directed.

As you know, the Act, in § 552(a)(6), grants your office no more than twenty working days in which to respond to this request. <i>See also Oglesby v. U.S. Dep't of Army</i>, 920 F.2d 57, 65 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("Congress adopted the time limit provision in the FOIA in order to 'contribute to the fuller and faster release of information, which is the basic objective of the Act.'" (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 93-876, March 5, 1974., reprinted (1974) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6267 at 6271)). Therefore, agencies "should make it a priority to respond in a timely manner. Timely disclosure of information is an essential component of transparency." Attorney General's Memorandum for Heads of Executive Dep'ts and Agencies Concerning the Freedom of Info. Act, at 3 (Mar. 19, 2009), available from http://www.justice.gov/ag/foia-memo-march2009.pdf.

I therefore look forward to your prompt reply.

Sincerely,


[@REALNAME]
